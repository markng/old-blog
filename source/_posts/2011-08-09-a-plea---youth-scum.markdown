For my birthday, I want my friends to remember this.  Many of you on these social networks got to know me well after I was nineteen, which is when I started to turn my life around, so you may not know about my, honestly, somewhat thuggish past.  But some of you were around then.  Those of you I still talk to are, in part, responsible for the turn around in my life.  You provided a ladder up out of the path that I had set myself upon (and I believed was my only choice).

During the London riots, I've seen lots of you ask for simple solutions to complex societal problems.  "Get the army out and kill them all", "They should be locked up and have the key thrown away", "They're irredeemable scum" are the types of sentiment that I'm paraphrasing that I've seen from many of my friends.

Don't get me wrong here. There's plenty of punishment that needs to go around and reparations that these rioters need to make.  They're unquestionably in the wrong.  But don't pretend that there are no real underlying causes. Don't pretend that everyone is irredeemable to society.  We need to spend the time after the riots in quiet reflection of how to mend our society so this doesn't happen in the future.

For those of you who knew me as a teenager - you know better than this because you've seen the change in my life.  You've seen me become a successful consultant, programmer, event organiser, and now know me as someone who gives as much to the communities he lives in as he can.  You played a part in this, more than you know. You can still play these parts in the lives of others, instead of advocating for their disposal.

For those of you who've gotten to know me since - I hope that most of you consider me one of the people you know who are least likely to physically hurt anyone. Know this - as a child, I was thrown out of two schools and a college - in all cases for forms of violent conduct.  I never completed any form of formal education.  I was exactly the kind of youth who would have been rioting.  Despite this (and due to the help of friends and mentors), I eventually turned my life around, and am relatively successful.  *Please* think about this before you irredeemably condemn our youth.
